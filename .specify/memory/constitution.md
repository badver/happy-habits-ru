# Psychologist Landing Page Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Conversion-First Design
**Primary KPI Target: ≥5% conversion rate (traffic → contact) within 30 days of launch**

Every design, content, and technical decision MUST be evaluated against conversion impact:
- First screen CTA click-through rate (CTR) MUST achieve ≥8%
- Mobile traffic MUST account for ≥60% of conversions
- Response time SLA (≤2 hours) MUST be prominently displayed
- All conversion paths (Telegram, WhatsApp, form) MUST be instrumented with UTM tracking
- A/B testing framework MUST be implemented from day one

*Rationale*: This is a direct-response marketing asset, not a branding site. Every element exists to drive qualified leads to contact channels.

### II. Mobile-First Performance
**Performance Budget: Lighthouse Mobile Score ≥90, LCP ≤2.5s**

Mobile performance is NON-NEGOTIABLE:
- Design starts at 360px viewport, scales up to 1920px
- Three mandatory breakpoints: mobile, tablet, desktop
- All media MUST use lazy loading, WebP/AVIF formats
- Critical CSS MUST be inlined, scripts minimized
- Static site generation required (Hugo, 11ty, Astro, or similar)
- Build-time optimization over runtime processing
- Performance validation MUST pass before deployment

*Rationale*: 60%+ of target audience (anxious individuals seeking help) will access from mobile devices, often in moments of acute distress. Slow loading = lost conversions. Static sites provide inherent performance advantages.

### III. Evidence-Based Communication
**Tone: Доказательный, конкретный, измеримый**

All content claims MUST be:
- Specific and measurable (e.g., "8-12 sessions", "7-8 из 10 клиентов")
- Grounded in methodology (КПТ/CBT evidence base)
- Free of medical jargon and "cure" promises
- Transparent about process, timelines, costs
- Accompanied by social proof (testimonials, case anonymized data)

Forbidden patterns:
- Vague promises ("Вы почувствуете себя лучше")
- Medical overreach ("Мы вылечим депрессию")
- Pressure tactics without value ("Только сегодня!" without justification)

*Rationale*: Target audience is skeptical and research-oriented. Trust is built through specificity and professional restraint.

### IV. Privacy & Trust
**Data Protection: GDPR-compliant, professional ethics standard**

User trust MUST be protected at every touchpoint:
- All forms MUST include explicit consent checkboxes
- Privacy Policy and Terms of Service MUST be accessible from every page
- No data collection without clear purpose disclosure
- Professional confidentiality badge prominently displayed
- Disclaimer about medical emergencies (when to seek immediate care)
- INN/OGRNIP displayed if applicable

*Rationale*: Mental health services require higher trust threshold than standard commercial services. One privacy misstep destroys credibility.

### V. Measurement & Iteration
**Analytics Framework: GA4 + Yandex.Metrika + Conversion Tracking**

Data-driven optimization is mandatory:
- All CTA buttons MUST fire conversion events
- Scroll depth and time-on-page MUST be tracked
- Video engagement MUST be measured
- Form submissions MUST route to CRM/Sheets/Telegram bot
- Exit-intent triggers MUST be A/B tested
- Monthly performance review cycle established

Post-launch testing pipeline (2-4 weeks):
- Hero variants (free diagnostic vs. discount offer)
- CTA copy ("Записаться" vs. "Написать в Telegram")
- Block ordering (results-first vs. expertise-first)
- Urgency messaging (scarcity vs. value-focused)

*Rationale*: First version is a hypothesis. Continuous improvement requires rigorous measurement and willingness to invalidate assumptions.

### VI. Static Site Architecture
**Tech Stack: Static Site Generator (Hugo/11ty/Astro) + Git-based deployment**

Site MUST be fully static with no server-side runtime:
- Static site generator selection based on: build speed, Russian language support, template flexibility
- All pages generated at build time (no SSR, no client-side routing)
- Forms submit to external services (Formspree, Google Forms, or custom webhook)
- Analytics injected via script tags (client-side only)
- Deployment via Git push (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or similar)
- Preview environments for every branch

Prohibited patterns:
- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Database connections
- Backend API dependencies (except analytics/forms)
- WordPress, Tilda, or CMS platforms requiring runtime

*Rationale*: Static sites provide maximum performance, security, and reliability for a single-page landing. No server maintenance, instant global CDN, perfect for paid traffic campaigns.

### VII. Russian Language Only
**Content Language: 100% Russian (ru-RU), no internationalization**

Site MUST serve exclusively Russian-speaking audience:
- All content, UI labels, error messages in Russian
- No i18n libraries or language switchers
- HTML lang="ru", proper Cyrillic encoding (UTF-8)
- Russian-optimized typography (correct quotes «», dashes —, non-breaking spaces)
- Yandex.Metrika prioritized over Google Analytics (Russian audience behavior)
- SEO keywords in Russian (see Section 3.4 of TZ)
- Meta tags, OG tags, Schema.org markup in Russian

Typography requirements:
- Correct Russian typography: « » for quotes, not " "
- Em dash (—) for sentence breaks, not hyphen (-)
- Non-breaking spaces (nbsp) before: units, short words, prepositions
- Proper capitalization (lowercase after colon in lists)

*Rationale*: Target audience is exclusively Russian-speaking (Russia, CIS countries). Internationalization adds complexity with zero business value. Russian typography signals professionalism to local audience.

   - Forms validate inputs correctly
   - Exit-intent popup triggers

**Test Execution**:
- Run via MCP Playwright tools: `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate`, `mcp__playwright__browser_click`, `mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot`
- Tests MUST be executable from command line (CI/CD integration)
- Test failures MUST block deployment
- Screenshot on failure for debugging

**Example Test Structure**:
```
Test: Hero CTA Click
1. mcp__playwright__browser_navigate to homepage
2. mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot to verify hero section
3. mcp__playwright__browser_click on "Бесплатная диагностика"
4. Verify Telegram deeplink opened
```

## Governance

### Amendment Process
1. **Proposal**: Document proposed change with business justification
2. **Impact Analysis**: Assess effect on conversion metrics and user trust
3. **Stakeholder Review**: Client (психолог) approval required
4. **Implementation**: Update constitution, increment version, sync templates
5. **Validation**: Confirm no regression in key metrics post-change

### Version Control
- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Fundamental principle redefinition (e.g., abandoning conversion focus)
- **MINOR** (1.X.0): New principle added or significant expansion (e.g., adding accessibility requirements)
- **PATCH** (1.0.X): Clarifications, wording refinements, threshold adjustments

### Compliance Verification
All feature work MUST include Constitution Check gate in planning:
- Does this feature maintain/improve conversion paths?
- Does it meet mobile performance budget?
- Is communication evidence-based and transparent?
- Does it protect user privacy appropriately?
- Can we measure its effectiveness?
- Is static site architecture preserved (no SSR/database)?
- Is all content in Russian with correct typography?
- Are Playwright MCP tests written for new user flows?

Violations require explicit justification in Complexity Tracking section of plan.md.

### Project-Specific Guidance
- See `/specs/[feature]/plan.md` for feature-level architectural decisions
- See `.specify/templates/` for template structure and requirements
- All agents (Claude, Copilot, etc.) MUST reference this constitution via agent-file updates
